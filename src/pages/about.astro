    <p>
      I'm Sam. I live in Singapore with my wife and our twin daughters, born in 2018. They've been
      a daily reminder that nothing I planned in my 20s and 30s fully prepared me for this.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2021, I was sitting in a classroom at SMU doing my master degree learning how transformers work, 
      the architecture that underpins most of what we now call generative AI. At the same time, I was at 
      SAP trying to get machine learning adopted inside a large enterprise. The gap between theory and 
      practice was substantial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Three years later, that gap has narrowed, though not in the way I expected. The tools caught up 
      and moved faster than the academic curve. What took months for me to understand formally, my 
      daughters will grow up using as default infrastructure. That shift is what this site explores.
    </p>

    <p>
      My day job is making AI real inside SAP, not building the models, but figuring out why a
      tool that demos beautifully still isn't used six months after rollout. Compliance reviews,
      change management, enablement programs. After seeing that gap enough times, it stops being 
      surprising and starts being instructive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before this, I spent years in investment banking. Financial statements, valuation models, 
      capital allocation. Alongside that, I read obsessively about personal finance: budgeting, 
      long term investing, building wealth steadily, avoiding avoidable mistakes. One was a career. 
      The other became a philosophy.
    </p>

    <h2>What I write about</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Parenting</strong> — the honest stuff. What it's actually like to raise twins, and
      the bigger question of how to prepare two small humans for a world that's changing faster
      than any parenting manual can track.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Money</strong> — practical thinking about building financial security for a family.
      I am not a financial advisor. I am a parent who has thought carefully about capital, risk, 
      and time, and made enough mistakes to have earned a few opinions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>AI & Work</strong> — neither hype nor panic. A clear look at what is changing, 
      what it means for careers, and which skills are likely to compound over the next twenty years.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I write</h2>

    <p>
      Writing forces clarity, even when assisted by AI.<br>
      <br>
      Most of what you read here is me testing and refining what I believe about parenting, money, and 
      building a life that holds together under pressure.<br>
      <br>
      My daughters are seven now. One day they will be old enough to read this. I would like them to find something useful in it. If you do as well, that is a bonus.
